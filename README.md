Given the need to include steps for setting up Clerk and Convex, I'll revise the README instructions to incorporate these critical steps. This update ensures users know they must obtain and set their Clerk API keys and initialize their Convex project before fully utilizing the template.

# FullStackStarterKit

This repository is a comprehensive template for starting full-stack web development projects, pre-configured with Next.js, Clerk, Convex, ShadcnUI, and TailwindCSS. It's designed to provide a robust foundation for building scalable and modern web applications.

## How to Use the FullStackStarterKit

To clone this template and start your own project, follow these instructions.

### Step 1: Clone the Template

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/FullStackStarterKit.git YourNewProjectName
cd YourNewProjectName
```

### Step 2: Initialize Your Project

```bash
rm -rf .git
git init
```

### Step 3: Create a New GitHub Repository

Create a new repository on GitHub for your project. Do not initialize it with any files since your project already includes them.

### Step 4: Link Your Project to the New Repository

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your_username/YourNewProjectName.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit from FullStackStarterKit"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 5: Set Up Clerk

1. Visit [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com) and create an account or log in.
2. Create a new instance for your project and obtain your Clerk Frontend API Key and Clerk Secret Key.
3. Copy `.env.local.sample` to a new file named `.env.local` and fill in your Clerk keys:

   ```plaintext
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API=your_clerk_frontend_api_key
   CLERK_API_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
   ```

### Step 6: Set Up Convex

1. Run the following command to initialize your Convex development environment:

   ```bash
   npx convex dev
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to configure a new Convex project.
3. The CLI will automatically update your `.env.local` with the necessary Convex configuration.

### Step 7: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Or if you're using Yarn:

```bash
yarn
```

### Step 8: Start Developing

With Clerk and Convex configured, and dependencies installed, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your application.
